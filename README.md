# **DSA Assignments**

This repo will have all the programs written by me as a part of our Data Structures and Algorithms course in our college.

#### List of Programs:

- Search an element in 2-D array using linear search
- Binary Search using both iterative and recursive methods
- Operations (+ , - , x ,Transpose) on Matrices
- Quick sort algorithms using both iterative and recursive methods
- String Operations
- Swapping two variables (call by reference & call by value)
- Operations On LinkedList (Insert,Delete,Update,Reverse,Pop,Append,Prepend)
- Compare Sorting and Searching Algorithms (Chrono Library)

## Note:

---

List of Programs will be updated as the classes go on.
